## Overview
I am a passionate software engineer with an affinity for game security and anti-tamper solutions. I have 10+ years of system-level software development and reverse engineering experience. My skills are based primarily in game development, low level kernel development, debugging, reverse engineering, and hardware assisted virtualization. I favor programming in C/C++, Python, Rust, and Go, however I have a wide variety of skills working with many higher level programming and scripting languages including C#, Java, JS, Python, Lua, and Ruby.
